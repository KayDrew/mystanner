    <p>This Data Deletion Policy outlines how MyStanner ("we," "our," or "us") handles the storage and deletion of user data obtained through Facebook Login via the Meta Graph API.

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>When users log in to our app using Facebook Login, we collect the following information via the Meta Graph API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User ID</strong> (a unique identifier provided by Facebook)</li>
        <li><strong>Access Token</strong> (used for authentication during the session)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No additional personal data (e.g., name, email, profile picture, etc.) is stored by our app.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
    <p>The collected data is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate the user during their session.</li>
        <li>To provide a personalized experience within the app during the session.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>We adhere to Meta's data retention requirements and do not store user data beyond the necessary timeframe. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Storage:</strong> User data (User ID and Access Token) is stored only for the duration of the user's session, which lasts a maximum of <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Logout:</strong> If the user logs out of the app before the 30-minute session expires, their data is deleted immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Deletion:</strong> After 30 minutes of inactivity, the user's session data is automatically deleted from our systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion Process</h2>
    <p>We have implemented the following processes to ensure timely deletion of user data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Expiry:</strong> All user data is automatically deleted after 30 minutes from the start of the session.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Logout:</strong> If the user logs out manually, their data is deleted immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>No Persistent Storage:</strong> We do not store user data in any persistent storage (e.g., databases, backups, or logs) beyond the active session.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. User Requests for Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>If a user wishes to request the deletion of their data before the session expires, they can do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log out of the app manually, which will trigger immediate deletion of their data.</li>
        <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@belotechs.co.za">info@belotechs.co.za</a> for assistance with data deletion requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Not storing user data beyond the necessary timeframe.</li>
        <li>Not using user data for any purpose other than authentication and session management.</li>
        <li>Ensuring data is deleted promptly after the session ends or the user logs out.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
